This is my first art project using Prismacolor Pencils. While I have done more
than a few projects using graphite, this was my foray into using color. I was
astonished at how amazing Prismacolors were to work with. Not only did the pencils 
allow me to essentially "paint" with pencils, they were also eraseable as well!
