Overview::
- The goal of this project is to practice the workflow of social coding — learning to collaborate within a group on a common set of data.
 
- Each team will deliver a simple website that is hosted on Github.com using the Github Pages service (https://pages.github.com/).
 
- Github Pages is typically used to host an informational website about a technical project; in this case, there is no technical project behind the website, but you can just write a placeholder file (like a README file) to have something in the master branch, or you can create a group and make an organization page (https://help.github.com/articles/user-organization-and-project-pages/) instead. 


1. Create a new repository for your project using either the organization site or Project site model.

2. Use GitHub Pages (and optionally the Jekyll static site generator) to create a website for your project: https://pages.github.com/

3. Start creating content. You can create a site for our course, or a pretend site for the (non-existent) technical project you created earlier, or even something completely unrelated to our class topic. 

4. You should use the collaboration tools provided by Github to assist (such as Pull requests, and the Conversation mechanism that is provided). If these situations don’t naturally occur in your project, engineer them.



Requirements::
- there should be a minimum of one content unit per team member on the site, and some images.
- each content unit contain edits by at least two members of the team.

Grading Criteria::
- how much you individually contributed to the project (as evidenced by the Github records)
- how broadly your team used the version control features of git and the collaboration features available in Github.
- At a minimum, I expect at least one pull request per content unit in your site.
